Logbot Widget (#g0v.tw 特仕版)
==============================
Logbot Widget is a Mac client for the [Logbot](https://github.com/dannvix/Logbot) project. By default, this app is designed to connect to #g0v's Logbot deployment [http://logbot.g0v.tw](http://logbot.g0v.tw), and watch `#g0v.tw` on freenode. Currently it doesn't have a preference panel for modify those settings.
